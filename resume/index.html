<hr>
<p>
	I've been coding for as long as I can remember, my father taught me Ruby early on and I've been studying more languages.
	After learning Ruby I found many different languages on the Internet and learned as much as I could about HTML, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript and Lua.
	I rather enjoyed C++ and went deeper into that by making short text based games.
</p>
<p>
	I took several programming classes at ACC with the majority focusing on C++ and game development.
	Using SDL2 I made several <a href="http://gamejolt.com/@gertkeno/games">games on Gamejolt</a> most of which are <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/">open source on Bitbucket</a>.
	Currently I'm working in OpenGL for 3D graphics in other short games.
	My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cptgthkeno/videos">Youtube Channel</a> has some videos of the games I've made, mostly when in progress.
</p>
<p>I've built a web server with C++ and <a href="https://think-async.com/">ASIO</a>'s networking I/O. It's a basic link aggregate site, hopefully up at <a href="http://gerthouse.com">gerthouse.com</a>.</p>
<p>I'm trying to write more in-depth <a href="http://gert.us/project/">blog posts on my projects</a>, and my thoughts through out making them, on my <a href="http://gert.us/">Website, Gert.us</a>.</p>
