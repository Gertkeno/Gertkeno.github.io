# Experience

### VESSELS (2019 - 2020)

- UE4, C++, Tools/Backend
- [Github repo](https://github.com/Gertkeno/airlock)
<!--- [steam or itch page here](https://example.com)-->

For this game I created a dialogue system integrated in UE4.
The system streamlines game dialogue editing into text files with verbose error
checking. We initially tried to have dialogue entirely through blueprints,
and found it very difficult to read and edit the flow of such a narrative heavy game.

### Flappatron (2019)

- C++, Tools/Backend, GameMaker Studio
- [Steam Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1009750/Flappatron/)

I created automatic lip syncing algorithms and manual lip syncing tools
as part of a remote team. Automating lip syncing proved too difficult to
achieve the results we wanted, so we shifted gears and focused on speeding up
manually lip syncing.

### Meme Game 23D (2016 - 2018)

- C++, OpenGL, Valgrind
- [Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game-23d)
- [Homemade Trailer](https://youtu.be/p9rINCeBq4s)

This game was created for a lovely community of artists I found through Twitch!
My debut 3D game and first time tinkering with OpenGL. It also catalogs the
start of me using Linux first to develop, I'm very confident in cross-platform
development and debugging thanks to this experience.

### Venforma Contract SDET (2017 - 2018)

- Selenium, Python, phantomjs
- [Company Site](http://www.venforma.com/)

I created automated full-stack tests for client websites.

### Code2College Volunteer Instructor (2017 - 2018)

- Python, NodeJS
- [Program Site](https://code2college.org/)

I taught full stack web development to students in a one on one setting.
This wasn't my first time teaching, but I learned plenty of teamwork and
semi-public speaking skills and I cherish opportunities to teach again.
