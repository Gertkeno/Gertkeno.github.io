[p
	I've been coding for as long as I can remember, my father taught me Ruby early on and I've been studying more languages.
	After learning Ruby I found many different languages on the Internet and learned as much as I could about HTML, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript and Lua.
	I rather enjoyed C++ and went deeper into that by making short text based games.

[p
	I took several programming classes at ACC with the majority focusing on C++ and game development.
	Using SDL2 I made several [a@http://gamejolt.com/@gertkeno/games games on Gamejolt] most of which are [a@https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/ open source on Bitbucket].
	Currently I'm working in OpenGL for 3D graphics in other short games.
	My [a@https://www.youtube.com/user/cptgthkeno/videos Youtube Channel] has some videos of the games I've made, mostly when in progress.

[p I've built a web server with C++ and [a@https://think-async.com/ ASIO]'s networking I/O. It's a basic link aggregate site, hopefully up at [a@http://gerthouse.com gerthouse.com].]
[p I'm trying to write more in-depth [a@http://gert.us/project/ blog posts on my projects], and my thoughts through out making them, on my [a@http://gert.us/ Website, Gert.us].]
