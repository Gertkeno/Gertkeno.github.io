		<h2 id="Goals">A Plan and Why</h2>
		<p>
			I followed the majority of <a href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php#Hello%20SDL">Lazy Foo's SDL Tutorials</a> and wrote some basic classes to make SDL2 rendering easier for me.
			After learning and building confidence with SDL2 I wanted to start one more game before switching to OpenGL.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wanted to make a boss fight centered game, it seemed like a good genre to code a lot of specific, odd, and unique actions.
			I knew from my previous projects making art sucks. I wanted to do 90% code, 10% art.
			Doing so little of my own art would be tough for an original and creative project, at least without hiring a dedicated artist.
			Luckily I'm part of a community that to some degree appreciates memes, instead of art I could just pull stuff from the internet or streams.
			By pandering to this community I'm almost guaranteed some kind of audience, thus two problems solved in one decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			For some reason I always wanted to attempt a cut-scene system, with boss rush genre in mind it would add some personality and/or jokes to the bosses.
			I made my own syntax for the cut-scene actions, other than specific sentinels it was just plain text files read in-game.
		</p>
		<p>I wrote some basic Asteroids/LUFTRAUSERS movement, filled a test intro.txt with the opening of 2003's Daredevil, and made the demo video below.</p>

		<p>
			I sent this video to a member of the previously mentioned community, name of <a href="https://twitter.com/MakinBaconBot">Makin Bacon Bot</a>, in attempt to start collaborating with them.
			Thankfully Makin agreed to write the cut scenes for the game, and design the boss made after him.

		<p>
			I started out with FrankerZ (Dog Face no space), this boss was made to test projectiles and hurt/hit circles.
			Movement was very basic for this boss, just a set speed in a set direction, sometimes changing either variable.
			At this point in the project I just had a background, temporary player, and an emote from twitch, being FrankerZ.
			I made projectiles call a function pointer every time an ability variable was timed out, with FrankerZ I used this to add LilZ bullets that spurt out six more.
		</p>
		<p>
			This projectile feature was robust in some ways, more limited in others, and made it annoying to initialize en masse.
			Current me would rather make an enumerated list of different abilities then union any specific variables needed for said enum list's contents.
			Sadly at the time I didn't know how to implement unions.
			If I made projectile functions as an enumerated list I could've made trajectory changes and timing easier for the functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The whale Lonny Linda is pretty much just a individual parts test, even though it's never implemented anywhere else.
			Since I wasn't using OpenGL I didn't have a proper way to connect the body segments, when turning the whale would split and overlap at the neck.
			Below is how I kept the tail connected in a rope like style.

	_myPoints[ 0 ] = { (int)_xBuffer, (int)_yBuffer };

						<li class="red">get the distance between point N and N+1</li>
						<li class="green">if it's greater than the diameter of a body segment</li>
						<li class="yellow">add the difference of distance to point N+1 normally</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>I didn't ever change the <span class="code">get_normal_diffXY</span> function to return a point, so it relies on reference/pointers being passed.</p>
