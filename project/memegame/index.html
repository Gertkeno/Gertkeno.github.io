		<h2>Legend</h2>

		<h2 id="Motivation">Stupid Concepts, 100% Effort</h2>
		<p>
			From the start of my SDL2 career I've started projects themed around things I find silly, like both the overtly edgy games I made <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/minion-killer/79776">killing minions</a> or <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/dad-slayer-six/166188">a wave-based dad shooter</a>.
			I used these themes to build tests I would be satisfied with, rather than trying to make some sort of magnum opus while learning SDL2's features or a new C++ concept.
			I do genuinely like what I've made from a programming perspective, but I can't say I'm proud of these projects thematically.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I attempted a serious project title to be determined, I was, and still am re-writing so much code due to style or fundamentals being wrong it's tough to keep going.
			Where in a test/stupid project I'd just drop it at that point, take what I learned and attempt to apply it better next time.
			Making it a miracle I uploaded <a href="http://gamejolt.com/@gertkeno/games">four games</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Anyways on to Meme Game specifically.</p>

		<h2 id="Goals">The Plan And Why</h2>
		<p>
			I wanted to make a boss fight centered game, it seemed like a good genre to code a lot of specific, odd, and unique actions.
			I knew from my previous project, title to be determined, making art for games sucks. I wanted to do 90% code, 10% art.
			Doing so little of my own art would be tough for an original and creative project, at least without hiring a dedicated artist.
		</p>
		<p>
			Luckily I'm part of a community full of artists that to some degree appreciate specific memes, instead of paying them what little money I don't have, I could just pull stuff from the internet.
			By pandering to this community I'm almost guaranteed some kind of audience, thus two problems solved in one decision.
			So now we have a genre I really enjoy, the best possible theme for a silly game, and an audience I love.
		</p>
		<p>
			I start making the game with Asteroids/LUFTRAUSERS movement and a basic hit/hurt circle system. Simple sine of angle and radius checks, tried and true stuff.
