		[h2#Goals A Plan and Why]
		[p
			I followed the majority of [a@http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php#Hello%20SDL Lazy Foo's SDL Tutorials] and wrote some basic classes to make SDL2 rendering easier for me.
			After learning and building confidence with SDL2 I wanted to start one more game before switching to OpenGL.
		]
		[p
			I wanted to make a boss fight centered game, it seemed like a good genre to code a lot of specific, odd, and unique actions.
			I knew from my previous projects making art sucks. I wanted to do 90% code, 10% art.
			Doing so little of my own art would be tough for an original and creative project, at least without hiring a dedicated artist.
			Luckily I'm part of a community that to some degree appreciates memes, instead of art I could pull stuff from the internet or streams.
			By pandering to this community I'm almost guaranteed some kind of audience, thus two problems solved in one decision.
		]
		[p
			For some reason I always wanted to attempt a cut-scene system, with boss rush genre in mind it would add some personality and/or jokes to the bosses.
			I made my own syntax for the cut-scene actions, other than specific sentinels it was plain text files read to an in-game system.
		]
		[p I wrote some basic Asteroids/LUFTRAUSERS movement, filled a test intro.txt with the opening of 2003's Daredevil, and made the demo video below.]

		[p
			I sent this video to a member of the previously mentioned community, name of [a@https://twitter.com/MakinBaconBot Makin Bacon Bot], in attempt to start collaborating with them.
			Thankfully Makin agreed to write the cut scenes for the game, and design the boss made after him.

		[h2#Boss Boss Design]
		[p
			I started out with FrankerZ (Dog Face no space), this boss was made to test projectiles and hurt/hit circles.
			Movement was very basic for this boss, just a set speed in a set direction, sometimes changing either variable.
			At this point in the project I had a background, temporary player, and an emote from twitch, being FrankerZ.
			I made projectiles call a function pointer every time an ability variable was timed out, with FrankerZ I used this to add LilZ bullets that spurt out six more.
		]
		[p
			This projectile feature was robust in some ways, more limited in others, and made it annoying to initialize en masse.
			Current me would rather make an enumerated list of different abilities then union any specific variables needed for said enum list's contents.
			Sadly at the time I didn't know how to implement unions.
			If I made projectile functions as an enumerated list I could've made trajectory changes and timing easier for the functions.
		]
		[p
			The whale Lonny Linda is solely an individual parts test.
			Since I wasn't using OpenGL I didn't have a proper way to connect the body segments, when turning the whale would split and overlap at the neck.
			Below is how I kept the tail connected in a rope like style.

		[table
			[tr
				[td.code
	_myPoints\[ 0 \] = { (int)_xBuffer, (int)_yBuffer };
	for( uint16_t i = 0; i < LL_MAX_POINTS - 1; i++ )
	{
		[span.red float pointDist = collision::distance( _myPoints\[ i \], _myPoints\[ i+1 \] );]
		[span.green if( pointDist > LL_RADIUS\*2 )]
		{
			[span.yellow float diffX, diffY;
			collision::get_normal_diffXY( _myPoints\[ i \], _myPoints\[ i+1 \], &amp;diffX, &amp;diffY );
			_myPoints\[ i+1 \].x += diffX \* ( pointDist - LL_RADIUS\*2 );
			_myPoints\[ i+1 \].y += diffY \* ( pointDist - LL_RADIUS\*2 );]
		}
	}
				]
				[td
					[ul
						[li.red get the distance between point N and N+1]
						[li.green if it's greater than the diameter of a body segment]
						[li.yellow add the difference of distance to point N+1 normally]
					]
				]
			]
		]
		[p
			Continuing beyond those two I tried to make unique and interesting bosses with four moves each, a theme, movement for the boss, and a reason for the player to move.
			The best example of this would be Tabe monster, and the worst being Hibby.

		[h2#Player Making The Ship]
		[p
			I wanted to copy LUFTRAUSERS' movement, so I did but without the gravity part.
			It ended up drifting around a lot more than I'd like so I added a system for special actions, with that a hard stop action.
		]
		[p
			I didn't think much about the system for special abilities, nor did I think of a great way to connect the bosses to said system.
			Scoring was simple and I would've rather had score be tied to the abilities than a mega-man style boss defeat to ability system.
			I should've added some text to describe what each ability does, there was plenty of space on the screen for it.
		]
		[p
			The camera zoomed in/out directly based on distance from player to a special point the boss held.
			This system would only move the camera if either the boss or player moved out of the zoomed view.
		]
		[p
			Having a nice thruster effect wasn't straight forward with just SDL2, I knew how I would've liked to do it in GL but I didn't know how to implement GL at the time.
			I ended up adding these little red particles [img{style="height:1em;"}$https://bytebucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game/raw/0e9049c93db96ef03d324961676a9b3a3cdac5a7/assets/ember.png ]) all over the ship when moving.
			I liked this system enough to give Makin the same sort draw effect, but with a crazy twist by making it blue instead of red.

		[h2#Final Final Product]
		[p Here's the video of the intended audience playing Meme Game.]
		[p I'm happy with how it turned out front-end. I've started the sequel since writing this, obviously with projects like these learning is the main goal so I'm much happier with part 2's code so far.]
		[p It was great to make a game for and with a community, even if they just wrote their name in the credits I'm happy they're a part of it.]
