		[p Let's just start this one with an example.]

		[p Jumping right in you might ask for my motivation, and I do have half a good reason for doing this. Good half: there's a great streamer on twitch called [a@https://www.twitch.tv/kitboga Kitboga], they call tech support scammers and wastes their time.]
		[p On good days the scammers will attempt to use some of windows packaged programs to disrupt and destroy our boy Kitboga's computer.]

		[p Now if you have a keen eye, good knowledge of how self destructive windows is, and watched the above clip you'll see the [a@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syskey#Malicious_use syskey] program was intentionally replaced with a gag program.]
		[p What I set out to do was create a [i "reasonable"] replacement for the notorious Windows text editor. For the bad half: Shortly into the project I found out his virtual machine doesn't support my favorite OpenGL 3.2]
		[p Pushing forward I decided it would still be a good test of compiling all my assets into the executable. Normally I'd use the [b xxd -i] command to convert the binary data of a file to a C compile-able form, but if all my 3D files are in [a@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file#File_format Wavefront Obj] format I figure making a specialized program would help.]
		[p Thus my second gert prefixed project was born [a@https://github.com/Gertkeno/gert-wavefrontc gert-wavefrontc], and with it the run-time loading was improved slightly. Basics of the project are that Wavefront is already a close to compilable data format, just replace [b v] with [b float vertex\[\]], [b vt] with [b float textureUV\[\]], etc. Not literally, but it's almost as simple as character swaps.]
