		<p>Hi I'm Garrett Hale, and I'm apparently a web developer. I didn't intend for it to be this way. I always stuck to my compiled languages assuming it would be too difficult to write and maintain a web site from just C++.</p>
		<p>However, a lovely library called <a href="https://think-async.com/">ASIO</a> hit all the marks for me. It's amazingly open-ended with expertly crafted asynchronous socket control. Sockets were always a bit too low-level for me to bother, and with ASIO filling that gap I'm unstoppable.</p>
		<p>My intent was just to make a site to host any client submitted links, no fancy databases or logins.</p>

			All the internet is really just a bunch of string parsing, I don't remember who I heard that from, but it was the most helpful part of starting this project.
			The majority of my initial research was checking <span class="code">curl -v</span> headers from other sites and throwing <span class="code">telnet</span> packets at my app.
			When it got more complicated I found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">MDN Web Docs</a> quite useful for things like Cookie and Cache headers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The link managment part was easy in a synchronous environment, sadly I never made a multi-threaded application.
			I wasn't used to mutexs, however I was familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization">resource allocation is initialization</a> idiom.
			GCC had some sort of naming error with <span class="code">std::shared_mutex</span>, causing an awful week for me. Since I was building this on my raspberrypi, with a similar distro I could just use C++17 without worrying about build dependencies not being available or hard to install, like my game development experience with Windows.

		<p>Just a lot of hackers really.</p>
		<p>
			Besides promoted tests, all traffic to my site was from myself, or bots trying php admin requests.
			The good news is that no one is trying to hack MY specific web server, just the most popular web servers.
			However my server was incredibly brittle at many points, so much so that case sensitivity on headers would crash it.
