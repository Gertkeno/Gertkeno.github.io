			I wanted to make a boss fight centered game, it seemed like a good genre to code a lot of specific, odd, and unique actions.
			I knew from my previous projects making art sucks. I wanted to do 90% code, 10% art.
			Doing so little of my own art would be tough for an original and creative project, at least without hiring a dedicated artist.
		</p>
		<p>
			Luckily I'm part of a community that to some degree appreciates memes, instead of art I could just pull stuff from the internet or streams.
			By pandering to this community I'm almost guaranteed some kind of audience, thus two problems solved in one decision.
			So now we have a genre I really enjoy, the best possible theme for a silly game, and an audience I love.

			This seemed like a good project to attempt a basic cut-scene system, add some personality and or jokes to the bosses.
			I made my own syntax for the cut-scene actions, other than those sentinels it was just plain text files read in-game.

		<p>I wrote some basic Asteroids/LUFTRAUSERS movement, filled a test intro.txt with the opening of 2003's Daredevil, and made the demo video below.</p>

		<p>I sent this video to a member of the previously mentioned community in attempt to start collaborating with them.</p>
