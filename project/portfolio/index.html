		<h2 id="Videos" class="chapter">Video Evidence of Games I've Done</h2>
		<p>The following is in-dev video games, since that's when I usually end up making videos.</p>
		<p>
			This is a sample of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/dadslayersix/downloads/">"Dad Slayer Six"</a> a wave-based twin stick shooter with power ups and a turret thing.
			I made this for a co-worker who hated Panera. I later had my friend do audio, music, and some art.

			My last 2D project before digging into 3D was <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game/downloads/">"Meme Game"</a> made for a specific community, of which I even got some story and art help from!
			It's a astroid ship doing boss fights, and boss fights are fun to program.
			The project was straight forward since I didn't have to do anything but code.
		</p>
		<p>This specific video is some muted basic game play.</p>

		<p>And this is the intended streamer playing the finished game.</p>

			After all this flat stuff I had an itch for OpenGL since I knew it would not only allow 3D but more complex, fun rendering in general.
			I started with a sequel to "Meme Game" aptly called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game-23d/downloads/">"Meme Game 2: 3D"</a>, I'm happy with the front-end result, but a lot of the rendering code is terrible.
			I did everythine except the music and cut scene backgrounds.

		<p>The following is a little trailer I made for "Meme Game 2", with less debugging spheres and more thanking.</p>

		<h2 id="NotGame" class="chapter">Non-Game Stuff</h2>
		<p>
			I wrote an HTTP server in C++ using boost's ASIO library, Somewhat to prepare for Code2College teaching since I didn't have much web dev experience before that.
			It should hopefully be live at <a href="http://gerthouse.com/">gerthouse.com</a>. It's just a link aggregate site hosted on a raspberrypi, I still need to implement the SSL/HTTPS things.
		</p>
		<p>
			After teaching at Code2College I got a job in web development thanks to Jorge's recommendation. No one asked me to do C++, but I still had some fun learning that world.
			I'd be happy to work more web dev jobs.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			This one is almost game related, I really wanted to compile assets instead of packaging loose jpgs and wavefronts.
			I didn't end up doing that for my first 3D game but I made a tool to help with the wavefront data.
			<a href="https://github.com/Gertkeno/gert-wavefrontc">My wavefront to C converter</a> is a pretty gross off and on project that just parses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">Wavefront file</a> and spits out two variables, a array of floats to represent the object, and the length of that array.

		<p>
			<code>test_vertices</code> is much more consumeable for OpenGL buffers, and easily compileable. Like how <code>xxd -i</code> works except specifically for Wavefront files.
			Sadly Wavefront files are very limited for 3D animation so this little app isn't useful for most devs.

		<h2 id="Sample" class="chapter">Code Samples</h2>
		<p>It's always tough to choose good bits of code. Two weeks from now I'll learn some new pattern or library that make previously awesome code redundant or overcomplicated. Here's some code I am, or was proud of.</p>
		<p>
			This is some controller code that reads from SDL2's event queue to set 0.0 - 1.0 for each input configured in <code>_controls</code>.
			The main reason I like this code is the use of function pointers and standardizing joysticks, keyboard, and mouse inputs to one struct.
