A Catalog of My Story in Reverse Chronological Order
====================================================

Bubble Ranch
------------

Made for [Global Game Jam 2025][GGJ25]! Focusing animation solely on the player
character made for a lovely animation tree system blending between mixed states
of crouching, raising the net, walking, and jumping. Godot handled it with ease,
our team scoped this game with perfect accuracy making for a smooth jam
experience.

I show this game to my students with glee, they have fun extending the game with
more animals and areas.

Twin Blade Tango
----------------

Made for [Texas Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/texas-game-jam-2024) I
grouped with old and new friends, all talented animators to produce a two-player
cooperative game. Learned Godot's animation system like never before, and spent
some time after the Jam to create a AI and make use of Godot's navigation
systems too.

I have re-used the Rose enemy for another game I secretly work on.

Hextype Mechapop
----------------

I hate the mouse; keyboard for everything! Vim and tilling window managers
or bust! We built this game as a simulacrum of that hacker-man stereotype
mashing keys 'till the machine explodes.

Again using Godot and leveraging the ever versatile input system, developing
in under a month everything snaps into place! We have more ideas for this
project, adding more weapons and a short campaign like that of rouge-likes, but
for now we work on bigger things.

Bun-Bun Fun Run
---------------

Built for EGADS Texas Game Jame 2023, theme "It's a trap!". This project
provided a lovely refresher on Unreal and learning some of the changes with
version five. A very cute and stylish physics-based platformer!

Roblox Games
------------

Working at [Sandshark Games](https://www.sandsharkgames.com/) I programmed
games of various genres. I learned the bounty of lovely foot guns Roblox
has to offer. I spent a fair amount of time learning and helping others through
the scripting support section of the
[devforum](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/gertkeno/summary)!

I teach Roblox as a after school program with local business "My Coding Place"!

Zoop Zoop Bee Adventures Seven
------------------------------

Having fun teaching mi amor game programming for Wasm4. We had a hard drive
failure but pressed on to re-make the game, this time with back ups! I even
bought the domain name "[zoopzoopadventures.com](https://zoopzoopadventures.com/)".

You may see both Zig and Wasm4 later in this list, I find this language and
fantasy console joyous to work with. This is my second Wasm4 project and a
avenue to teach Zig!

Go Godot Game Jam 2022
----------------------

First time using Godot I grouped up with my friends to make a aim training idle
game. I like Godot's quick launch, sane defaults, and broad feature set.

Crochet Helper
--------------

In my free time I crochet blankets, ponchos, and scarfs for my friends and
family. I prefer to make colorful flat images for these, previously I would
print out an image, draw a grid and stitch marks over it. This took a lot of
counting and other work I would like done by computers. This was also a great
excuse to use [Zig](https://ziglang.org) a programming language I love!

To The Core
-----------

[Zig](https://ziglang.org) has been wonderful to program personal games, and
integrates well with [wasm4](https://wasm4.org). Which I participated in the
wasm4 game jam and published to the core! My super cute girlfriend and I am
programming a multiplayer game with wasm4 which will make use of the new net
play feature! *This is zoop zoop!*

RIFT
----

I added new features to a large code base, including working on UI. I worked
hand in hand with designers and had a great time! Gamigo held a game jam of
which I lead a team to create [Solario](https://solariogame.itch.io/solario).
As of writing this RIFT is in maintenance mode and will not be receiving
updates.

Vessels - IGF Best Student Game
-------------------------------

**We won the [IGF 2021](https://igf.com/2021) best student game award!**

I was the lead programmer on a team of six developers making Vessels, a narrative
focused puzzle/exploration game. I created a concise dialogue system for
designers to write and test in-game dialogue and story paths quickly.

I wrote a good amount on what tools we looked at, how I implemented this system
as a virtual machine, and what I believe are important design philosophies in my
blog post [Game Dialogue Systems](/dialogue-systems/). When making a scripting
language I knew we'd be throwing away valuable debugging tools, I made sure to
keep the scope low, strict, and loud with tests/warnings as we needed new
features.

Flappatron
----------

I made tools for automatic and manual lip syncing in Flappatron, a unique and
charming game. I reached out to the lead developer with recommendations on how
to solve the lip syncing time sink they were facing, but open source and
custom automatic solutions weren't capable of handling the wide variety of
characters and voices. We opted to speed up the manual syncing process with
custom tools.

Meme Game 2: 3D
---------------

I had an itch for diving in to OpenGL since I knew it would allow for 3D games
and more complex, fun rendering techniques. I started with a sequel to "Meme
Game" called ["Meme Game 2:
3D"](https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game-23d/downloads/). The game is a
boss-rush like *Star Fox 64* without the basic enemies, there is a mini-game
between bosses to collect power ups for later use. I wanted specific audio
features like looping music so I spent some time figuring out SDL2's bare bones
audio buffer system.

The following is a little trailer I made for "Meme Game 2", with less
debugging spheres and more thanking.

HTTPS Server
------------

I wrote an asynchronous HTTPS server in C++ using boost's ASIO library, to
prepare for Code2College teaching since I didn't have much web dev experience
before that. It should be live at [gerthouse.com](https://gerthouse.com/).

It's a link aggregate site hosted on a Raspberry Pi, my implementation takes
from [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230). Though I don't allow most
file manipulation functionality, instead sticking to what a browser would send.

I've since written another HTTP server in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) a lovely
experimental language that comes with TCP networking in the standard library.

Meme Game
---------

My last 2D project before digging into 3D was ["Meme
Game"](https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game/downloads/) made for a specific
community, of which I even got some story and art help from! It's asteroid
controls doing boss fights, and the boss fights were fun to program. With their
help my focus was on programming and making the enemies unique.

This is the intended streamer playing the finished game.

Dad Slayer Six
--------------

This is a sample of ["Dad Slayer
Six"](https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/dadslayersix/downloads/) a
wave-based twin stick shooter with power ups and a turret thing. Later my friend
helped by doing audio, music, and some art. Coded in C++ with SDL2.

Project Ant Farm
----------------

My first attempt at a proper 2D game is working-titled "Ant Farm". It's a idle
increment game using resource collection in such games as *Starcraft* or
*Age of Empires*. I argue it's still in development because I want to convert it
from 2D to 3D as a opportunity to study Vulkan.

Starfighter
-----------

I started game programming early on with this 2D Galaga-type game written in
Ruby. My father helped plenty and we gave a talk about it at a local Ruby on
Rails meet up! The code is over 10 years old and doesn't run without updating
gosu calls.
