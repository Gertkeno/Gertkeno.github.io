<h2 id="bubble-ranch">Bubble Ranch</h2>
<p>Made for <a
href="https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/bubble-man-bubble-land-7">Global
Game Jam 2025</a>! Focusing animation solely on the player character
made for a lovely animation tree system blending between mixed states of
crouching, raising the net, walking, and jumping. Godot handled it with
ease, our team scoped this game with perfect accuracy making for a
smooth jam experience.</p>
<p>I show this game to my students with glee, they have fun extending
the game with more animals and areas.</p>

to produce a two-player cooperative game. Learned Godot’s animation
system like never before, and spent some time after the Jam to create a
AI and make use of Godot’s navigation systems too.</p>
<p>I have re-used the Rose enemy for another game I secretly work
on.</p>

<p>I hate the mouse; keyboard for everything! Vim and tilling window

stereotype mashing keys ’till the machine explodes.</p>
<p>Again using Godot and leveraging the ever versatile input system,
developing in under a month everything snaps into place! We have more
ideas for this project, adding more weapons and a short campaign like
that of rouge-likes, but for now we work on bigger things.</p>

<p>Working at <a href="https://www.sandsharkgames.com/">Sandshark

<p>Having fun teaching mi amor game programming for Wasm4. We had a hard

ups! I even bought the domain name “<a

<p>You may see both Zig and Wasm4 later in this list, I find this
language and fantasy console joyous to work with. This is my second
Wasm4 project and a avenue to teach Zig!</p>

<h2 id="crochet-helper">Crochet Helper</h2>
<p>In my free time I crochet blankets, ponchos, and scarfs for my
friends and family. I prefer to make colorful flat images for these,
previously I would print out an image, draw a grid and stitch marks over
it. This took a lot of counting and other work I would like done by
computers. This was also a great excuse to use <a
href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> a programming language I love!</p>

<p>I added new features to a large code base, including working on UI. I
worked hand in hand with designers and had a great time! Gamigo held a

this RIFT is in maintenance mode and will not be receiving updates.</p>

Game</h2>
<p><strong>We won the <a href="https://igf.com/2021">IGF 2021</a> best
student game award!</strong></p>
<p>I was the lead programmer on a team of six developers making Vessels,
a narrative focused puzzle/exploration game. I created a concise
dialogue system for designers to write and test in-game dialogue and
story paths quickly.</p>
<p>I wrote a good amount on what tools we looked at, how I implemented
this system as a virtual machine, and what I believe are important
design philosophies in my blog post <a href="/dialogue-systems/">Game
Dialogue Systems</a>. When making a scripting language I knew we’d be
throwing away valuable debugging tools, I made sure to keep the scope
low, strict, and loud with tests/warnings as we needed new features.</p>

<h2 id="flappatron">Flappatron</h2>
<p>I made tools for automatic and manual lip syncing in Flappatron, a
unique and charming game. I reached out to the lead developer with
recommendations on how to solve the lip syncing time sink they were
facing, but open source and custom automatic solutions weren’t capable
of handling the wide variety of characters and voices. We opted to speed
up the manual syncing process with custom tools.</p>

<h2 id="meme-game-2-3d">Meme Game 2: 3D</h2>
<p>I had an itch for diving in to OpenGL since I knew it would allow for
3D games and more complex, fun rendering techniques. I started with a
sequel to “Meme Game” called <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game-23d/downloads/">“Meme
Game 2: 3D”</a>. The game is a boss-rush like <em>Star Fox 64</em>
without the basic enemies, there is a mini-game between bosses to
collect power ups for later use. I wanted specific audio features like
looping music so I spent some time figuring out SDL2’s bare bones audio
buffer system.</p>

debugging spheres and more thanking.</p>

<h2 id="https-server">HTTPS Server</h2>
<p>I wrote an asynchronous HTTPS server in C++ using boost’s ASIO
library, to prepare for Code2College teaching since I didn’t have much
web dev experience before that. It should be live at <a
href="https://gerthouse.com/">gerthouse.com</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a link aggregate site hosted on a Raspberry Pi, my
implementation takes from <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">RFC7230</a>. Though I don’t
allow most file manipulation functionality, instead sticking to what a
browser would send.</p>
<p>I’ve since written another HTTP server in <a
href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> a lovely experimental language that
comes with TCP networking in the standard library.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="meme-game">Meme Game</h2>
<p>My last 2D project before digging into 3D was <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game/downloads/">“Meme
Game”</a> made for a specific community, of which I even got some story
and art help from! It’s asteroid controls doing boss fights, and the
boss fights were fun to program. With their help my focus was on
programming and making the enemies unique.</p>

art. Coded in C++ with SDL2.</p>

<h2 id="project-ant-farm">Project Ant Farm</h2>
<p>My first attempt at a proper 2D game is working-titled “Ant Farm”.
It’s a idle increment game using resource collection in such games as
<em>Starcraft</em> or <em>Age of Empires</em>. I argue it’s still in
development because I want to convert it from 2D to 3D as a opportunity
to study Vulkan.</p>

<h2 id="starfighter">Starfighter</h2>
<p>I started game programming early on with this 2D Galaga-type game
written in Ruby. My father helped plenty and we gave a talk about it at
a local Ruby on Rails meet up! The code is over 10 years old and doesn’t
run without updating gosu calls.</p>
