<p>I've been coding for as long as I can remember, my father taught me Ruby early on and I've been studying more languages.
 After learning Ruby I found many different languages on the Internet and learned as much as I could about HTML, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript and Lua.
 I rather enjoyed C++ and went deeper into that by making short text based games.</p>
<p>Like in "The Pragmatic Programmer" I try to learn a new language every year, I've got a nice list of languages I'd like to check on somewhere. So far I'd say Logo is the weirdest.</p>
<p>I took several programming classes at ACC with the majority focusing on C++ and game development.
Using SDL2 I made several <a href="http://gamejolt.com/@gertkeno/games">games on Gamejolt</a> most of which are <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/">open source on Bitbucket</a>.
 Currently I'm working in OpenGL for 3D graphics in other short games.
 My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUn0pkTYwJ-KK5uePPhJ3cg">Youtube Channel</a> has some videos of the games I've made, mostly when in progress.</p>
 <p>I'm trying to write more in-depth <a href="http://gert.us/project/">blog posts on my projects</a>, and my thoughts through out making them, on my <a href="http://gert.us/">Website, Gert.us</a></p>
