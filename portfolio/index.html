<h2 id="roblox-games">Roblox Games</h2>
<p>Working at <a href="https://www.sandsharkgames.com/">Sandshark

lovely foot guns Roblox has to offer. I spent a fair amount of time
learning and helping others through the scripting support section of the

<p>Having fun teaching mi amor game programming for Wasm4. We had a hard
drive failure but pressed on to re-make the game, this time with back
ups! I even bought the domain name “<a
href="https://zoopzoopadventures.com/">zoopzoopadventures.com</a>”.</p>
<p>You may see both Zig and Wasm4 later in this list, I find this
language and fantasy console joyous to work with. This is my second
Wasm4 project and a avenue to teach Zig!</p>

<p>First time using Godot I grouped up with a few of my friends to make
a aim training idle game. I like Godot’s quick launch and broad feature
set, it’s a game engine made by and for programmers!</p>

<h2 id="zig---crochet-helper---wasm4">Zig - Crochet Helper - Wasm4</h2>
<p>In my free time I crochet blankets, ponchos, and scarfs for my
friends and family. I prefer to make colorful flat images for these,
previously I would print out an image, draw a grid and stitch marks over
it. This took a lot of counting and other work I would like done by
computers. This was also a great excuse to use <a
href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> a programming language I love!</p>

<p><a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> has been wonderful to program
personal games, and integrates well with <a
href="https://wasm4.org">wasm4</a>. Which I participated in the wasm4
game jam and published to the core! My super cute girlfriend and I am
programming a multiplayer game with wasm4 which will make use of the new
net play feature!</p>

<h2 id="rift">RIFT</h2>
<p>I added new features to a large code base, including working on UI. I
worked hand in hand with designers and had a great time! Gamigo held a
game jam of which I lead a team to create <a
href="https://solariogame.itch.io/solario">Solario</a>. As of writing
this RIFT is in maintenance mode and will not be receiving updates.</p>

<h2 id="vessels">Vessels</h2>
<p><strong>We won the <a href="https://igf.com/2021">IGF 2021</a> best
student game award!</strong></p>
<p>I was the lead programmer on a team of six developers making Vessels,
a narrative focused puzzle/exploration game. I created a concise
dialogue system for designers to write and test in-game dialogue and
story paths quickly.</p>
<p>I wrote a good amount on what tools we looked at, how I implemented
this system as a virtual machine, and what I believe are important
design philosophies in my blog post <a href="/dialogue-systems/">Game
Dialogue Systems</a>. When making a scripting language I knew we’d be
throwing away valuable debugging tools, I made sure to keep the scope
low, strict, and loud with tests/warnings as we needed new features</p>

<h2 id="flappatron">Flappatron</h2>
<p>I made tools for automatic and manual lip syncing in Flappatron, a
unique and charming game. I reached out to the lead developer with
recommendations on how to solve the lip syncing time sink they were
facing, but open source and custom automatic solutions weren’t capable
of handling the wide variety of characters and voices. We opted to speed
up the manual syncing process with custom tools.</p>

<h2 id="meme-game-2-3d">Meme Game 2: 3D</h2>
<p>I had an itch for diving in to OpenGL since I knew it would allow for
3D games and more complex, fun rendering techniques. I started with a
sequel to “Meme Game” called <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game-23d/downloads/">“Meme
Game 2: 3D”</a>. The game is a boss-rush like <em>Star Fox 64</em>
without the basic enemies, there is a mini-game between bosses to
collect power ups for later use. I wanted specific audio features like
looping music so I spent some time figuring out SDL2’s bare bones audio
buffer system.</p>

<p>The following is a little trailer I made for “Meme Game 2”, with less
debugging spheres and more thanking.</p>

<h2 id="https-server">HTTPS Server</h2>
<p>I wrote an asynchronous HTTPS server in C++ using boost’s ASIO
library, to prepare for Code2College teaching since I didn’t have much
web dev experience before that. It should be live at <a
href="https://gerthouse.com/">gerthouse.com</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a link aggregate site hosted on a Raspberry Pi, my
implementation takes from <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">RFC7230</a>. Though I don’t
allow most file manipulation functionality, instead sticking to what a
browser would send.</p>
<p>I’ve since written another HTTP server in <a
href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> a lovely experimental language that
comes with TCP networking in the standard library.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="meme-game">Meme Game</h2>
<p>My last 2D project before digging into 3D was <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game/downloads/">“Meme
Game”</a> made for a specific community, of which I even got some story
and art help from! It’s asteroid controls doing boss fights, and the
boss fights were fun to program. With their help my focus was on
programming and making the enemies unique.</p>

<p>This is a sample of <a

turret thing. Later my friend helped by doing audio, music, and some
art. Coded in C++ with SDL2.</p>

<h2 id="project-ant-farm">Project Ant Farm</h2>
<p>My first attempt at a proper 2D game is working-titled “Ant Farm”.
It’s a idle increment game using resource collection in such games as
<em>Starcraft</em> or <em>Age of Empires</em>. I argue it’s still in
development because I want to convert it from 2D to 3D as a opportunity
to study Vulkan.</p>

<h2 id="starfighter">Starfighter</h2>
<p>I started game programming early on with this 2D Galaga-type game
written in Ruby. My father helped plenty and we gave a talk about it at
a local Ruby on Rails meet up! The code is over 10 years old and doesn’t
run without updating gosu calls.</p>
