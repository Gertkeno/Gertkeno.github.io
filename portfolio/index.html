<h2 id="zig---crochet-helper---wasm4">Zig - Crochet Helper - Wasm4</h2>
<p>In my free time I crochet blankets, ponchos, and scarfs for my
friends and family. I prefer to make colorful flat images for these and
I use to print out an image, draw a grid and stitch marks over it. This
took a lot of counting and other work I would like done by computers.
This was also a great excuse to use <a
href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> a programming language I love!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Gertkeno/crochet_helper">Crochet Helper
Github.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> has been wonderful to program
personal games, and integrates well with <a
href="https://wasm4.org">wasm4</a>. Which I participated in the wasm4
game jam and published to the core! My super cute girlfriend and I are
programming a multiplayer game with wasm4 which will hopefully make use
of the new net play feature.</p>

<h2 id="rift">RIFT</h2>
<p>I added new features to a large code base, including working on UI. I
worked closely with designers and overall had a great time. Gamigo held
a game jam of which I lead a team to create <a
href="https://solariogame.itch.io/solario">Solario</a>. Sadly as of
writing this RIFT is on maintenance mode and will not be receiving
updates.</p>

<h2 id="vessels">Vessels</h2>
<p>I was the lead programmer on a team of six developers making Vessels,
a narrative focused puzzle/exploration game. My main objective was to
create a concise dialogue system for designers to quickly write and test
in-game dialogue and story paths.</p>
<p>I wrote a good amount on what tools we looked at, how I implemented
this system as a virtual machine, and what I believe are very important
design philosophies in my blog post <a href="/dialogue-systems/">Game
Dialogue Systems</a>. When making a scripting language I knew we’d be
throwing away valuable debugging tools, I made sure to keep the scope
low, strict, and loud with tests/warnings as new features were
added.</p>

<h2 id="flappatron">Flappatron</h2>
<p>I made tools for automatic and manual lip syncing in Flappatron, a
unique and charming game. I reached out to the lead developer with
recommendations on how to solve the lip syncing time sink they were
facing, sadly open source and custom automatic solutions weren’t capable
of handling the wide variety of characters and voices. We opted to speed
up the manual syncing process with custom tools.</p>

<h2 id="meme-game-2-3d">Meme Game 2: 3D</h2>
<p>I had an itch for OpenGL since I knew it would not only allow 3D but
more complex, fun rendering in general. I started with a sequel to “Meme
Game” aptly called <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game-23d/downloads/">“Meme
Game 2: 3D”</a>. The game is a boss-rush like <em>Star Fox 64</em>
without the basic enemies, there is a mini-game between bosses to
collect power ups for later use. I wanted specific audio features like
looping music so I spent some time figuring out SDL2’s bare bones audio
buffer system.</p>

<p>The following is a little trailer I made for “Meme Game 2”, with less
debugging spheres and more thanking.</p>

<h2 id="https-server">HTTPS Server</h2>
<p>I wrote an asynchronous HTTPS server in C++ using boost’s ASIO
library, to prepare for Code2College teaching since I didn’t have much
web dev experience before that. It should be live at <a
href="https://gerthouse.com/">gerthouse.com</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a link aggregate site hosted on a Raspberry Pi, my
implementation is based on <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">RFC7230</a>. Though I don’t
allow most file manipulation functionality, instead sticking to what a
browser would normally send.</p>
<p>I’ve since written another HTTP server in <a
href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> a lovely experimental language that
comes with TCP networking in the standard library.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="meme-game">Meme Game</h2>
<p>My last 2D project before digging into 3D was <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game/downloads/">“Meme
Game”</a> made for a specific community, of which I even got some story
and art help from! It’s asteroid controls doing boss fights, and the
boss fights were very fun to program. With help I could focus on
programming and making the enemies unique.</p>

<p>This is the intended streamer playing the finished game.</p>

<h2 id="dad-slayer-six">Dad Slayer Six</h2>
<p>This is a sample of <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/dadslayersix/downloads/">“Dad
Slayer Six”</a> a wave-based twin stick shooter with power ups and a
turret thing. Later my friend helped by doing audio, music, and some
art. Coded in C++ with SDL2.</p>

<h2 id="project-ant-farm">Project Ant Farm</h2>
<p>My first attempt at a proper 2D game is working-titled “Ant Farm”.
It’s a idle increment game using resource collection in such games as
<em>Starcraft</em> or <em>Age of Empires</em>. I argue it’s still in
development because I want to convert it from 2D to 3D as a opportunity
to study Vulkan.</p>

<h2 id="starfighter">Starfighter</h2>
<p>I started game programming early on with this 2D Galaga-type game
written in Ruby. My father helped plenty and we gave a talk about it at
a local Ruby on Rails meet up! The code is over 10 years old and doesn’t
run without updating gosu calls.</p>
