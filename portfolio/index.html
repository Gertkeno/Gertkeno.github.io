<h2 id="rift">RIFT</h2>
<p>I added new features to a large code base, including working on UI. I worked closely with designers and overall had a great time. Gamigo held a game jam of which I lead a team to create <a href="https://solariogame.itch.io/solario">Solario</a>. Sadly as of writing this RIFT is on maintenance mode and will not be receiving updates.</p>

<h2 id="vessels">Vessels</h2>
<p>I was the lead programmer on a team of six developers making Vessels, a narrative focused puzzle/exploration game. My main objective was to create a concise dialogue system for designers to quickly write and test in-game dialogue and story paths.</p>
<p>I wrote a good amount on what tools we looked at, how I implemented this system as a virtual machine, and what I believe are very important design philosophies in my blog post <a href="/dialogue-systems/">Game Dialogue Systems</a>. When making a scripting language I knew we’d be throwing away valuable debugging tools, I made sure to keep the scope low, strict, and loud with tests/warnings as new features were added.</p>

<h2 id="flappatron">Flappatron</h2>
<p>I made tools for automatic and manual lip syncing in Flappatron, a unique and charming game. I reached out to the lead developer with recommendations on how to solve the lip syncing time sink they were facing, sadly open source and custom automatic solutions weren’t capable of handling the wide variety of characters and voices. We opted to speed up the manual syncing process with custom tools.</p>

<h2 id="meme-game-2-3d">Meme Game 2: 3D</h2>
<p>I had an itch for OpenGL since I knew it would not only allow 3D but more complex, fun rendering in general. I started with a sequel to “Meme Game” aptly called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game-23d/downloads/">“Meme Game 2: 3D”</a>. The game is a boss-rush like <em>Star Fox 64</em> without the basic enemies, there is a mini-game between bosses to collect power ups for later use. I wanted specific audio features like looping music so I spent some time figuring out SDL2’s bare bones audio buffer system.</p>

<p>The following is a little trailer I made for “Meme Game 2”, with less debugging spheres and more thanking.</p>

<h2 id="https-server">HTTPS Server</h2>
<p>I wrote an asynchronous HTTPS server in C++ using boost’s ASIO library, to prepare for Code2College teaching since I didn’t have much web dev experience before that. It should be live at <a href="https://gerthouse.com/">gerthouse.com</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a link aggregate site hosted on a Raspberry Pi, my implementation is based on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC2616</a>. Though I don’t allow most file manipulation functionality, instead sticking to what a browser would normally send.</p>

<h2 id="meme-game">Meme Game</h2>
<p>My last 2D project before digging into 3D was <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/meme-game/downloads/">“Meme Game”</a> made for a specific community, of which I even got some story and art help from! It’s asteroid controls doing boss fights, and the boss fights were very fun to program. With help I could focus on programming and making the enemies unique.</p>

<p>This is the intended streamer playing the finished game.</p>

<h2 id="dad-slayer-six">Dad Slayer Six</h2>
<p>This is a sample of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gertkeno/dadslayersix/downloads/">“Dad Slayer Six”</a> a wave-based twin stick shooter with power ups and a turret thing. I later my friend did audio, music, and some art. Coded in C++ with SDL2.</p>

<h2 id="project-ant-farm">Project Ant Farm</h2>
<p>My first attempt at a proper 2D game is working-titled “Ant Farm”. It’s a idle increment game using resource collection in such games as <em>Starcraft</em> or <em>Age of Empires</em>. I argue it’s still in development because I want to convert it from 2D to 3D as a opportunity to study Vulkan.</p>
